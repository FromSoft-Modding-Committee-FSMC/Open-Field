# Open Field
An extensive project, working towards the following:
- A 'modern' replacement for the dated 'Sword of Moonlight King's Field Making Tool'
- An advanced converter, capable of taking the original game data of KF1/2/3jp and creating a working editor project from it.
- A runtime to play games made with the editor.
