# OpenField
An extensive project, currently in its infant stages.

The end goal is to have a modern replacement for SoM, built from the ground up. This will be done with the following projects:

## OpenFieldCore
Rendering/Audio/Collision/ETC written in C# and with minimal dependancies (OpenTK, Moonsharp)

# OpenFieldForge
A commandline application for conversion of many FromSoftware game formats, into native formats for the engine or intermediate formats for editing. Long term goals will be importing entire KFEngine and SoM engine games.

# OpenFieldEditor
An editing enviroment for creating and editing projects, and eventually exporting them into...

# OpenFieldRuntime
A runtime for playing games made with the Editor, targeting at least win32/win64/linux, and possibily ported to consoles in the future
